number of objects with a given content model at certain points of time.

REQUIREMENTS

Only the parent usc_mirc module should be necessary (along with its
dependencies).

Additionally, the GNU Multiple Precision library is required, due to huge file
size numbers being considered (Package name: "php5-gmp"). 

INSTALLATION

Install the GMP library if required, and then install this module as any other
Drupal module--drop into sites/all/modules or a site-specific module directory.
